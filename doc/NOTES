There are a few things the developer using Cex would need to keep in mind.

Using goto...
First of all, using the goto statement inside a TRY or CATCH block causes undefined behavoir. This is because of how setjmp & longjmp are defined, but also because then Cex doesn't know which try or catch block we are in anymore.
Also, controlling execution with return or longjmp are not allowed inside a try or catch block, this is because Cex doesn't know to which try or catch block execution goes.
These are the limitations of Cex.

Always put a catch block right after the try block...
If you do something like this, which is not like it is intended:
	try {
		...code...
	}
	...some extra code...
	catch {
		...code...
	}
That extra code is going to break the try-catch statement, and C errors about the code behind the macro's is going to show up.
