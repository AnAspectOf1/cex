Cex has no dependencies.
This project has a makefile that uses gcc.
To build a dynamic library (libcex.so), just use:

	make

If you want a static library, just use:

	make static

You can have both at the same time.
To clean everything use:

	make clean

To test if it is working correctly, use:

	make test

To install Cex, use:

	make install

This will install the static or dynamic library, or both if both were build.
